Copy media to camera roll preserving metadata

### The problem
When copying files to the camera roll, they end up with the copy date rather than the original date.

### The solution
By using iTunes to copy the desired files to Caneloni's folder and then using CAneloni to move them to the caemra roll, the original date will be preserved.

NB that they will still appear in the camera's listing itself at the moment of copy, but when browsing albums they will be in the correct place.

## To do
There are some possible features that I have had no interest in developing so far.

- Log visualiser

## Known issues
This is a quick solution and improvements are welcome, but don't expect it to be flawless. I've had no issues with moving the files, but the UI isn't perfect.

- Labels don't start updating until the screen is rotated
